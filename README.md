# Naive Bayes Classification

This project implements the **Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm** in Python. Naive Bayes is a simple yet powerful probabilistic machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It assumes that features are conditionally independent given the class label, making it efficient and effective for many real-world applications.

## Introduction
The Naive Bayes algorithm is based on Bayesâ€™ theorem, which provides a way of calculating conditional probabilities. It is widely used for tasks like spam detection, sentiment analysis, and more. This project explores its application in **classification tasks** and showcases how it can be used to make predictions based on training data.

## Features
- Naive Bayes classifier implementation from scratch in Python.
- Handles text and numeric data for classification.
- Supports multiple datasets for different classification tasks.
- Displays classification accuracy and confusion matrix.
- Detailed step-by-step explanation of each code section for ease of understanding.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: 
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`

You can install the required libraries by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/naive_bayes_classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd naive_bayes_classification
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook naive_bayes.ipynb
   ```

Follow the notebook's instructions to train the model on your dataset and visualize the results.

## Dataset
The program can work with different types of datasets (text, numerical). For demonstration purposes, you can either use preloaded datasets or import your own data in `.csv` format. Be sure to preprocess the data (e.g., encoding categorical variables, splitting into train/test sets) before feeding it into the model.

## Results
After training, the Naive Bayes model will provide:
- Classification accuracy
- Precision, recall, and F1-score metrics
- Confusion matrix for detailed performance analysis
- Visualizations to compare predicted vs actual results

## Contributing
Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests. Any contributions to improve the implementation or add new features are welcome.
